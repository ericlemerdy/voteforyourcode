# FAQ

## Episode 1: The One In The Elevator

* **How can I ask question ?**

	The best way is on twitter : [@codestory](https://twitter.com/CodeStory)

* **Is the contest started ?**
	
	The contest is not started, we will start keeping score on Monday, October 14th. We only relevealed a part of the subject, to familiarize yourself with the broad topic. This is also the time for future contestant to start building team.
	
* **It's not started but people are already coding !**

	Yes some people are training, but the rules are going to change a lot in Monday, October 14th. The only thing, that will not change much is the way we interogate the elevator. So the time starting now up to October Monday 17th, should be spent trying to setup a basic elevator, and join/form a team.

* **How many team can I join ?**
	
	You should join one and only one team. There can be an unlimited number of team member within one team.
	Team can be people who gather around language, programming style, geographical or anything really.

	There will be an individual ladder and a team ladder.
	  			
* **When will the contest really start then ?**

	The contest will start on Monday, October 14th. We will reveal the final episode 1 subject on the blog.

* **I've heard it's about an elevator algorithm, where can I find some instructions.**

	Instructions are at your disposal at the code-story blog : [The One In The Elevator](/blog/posts/s03e01)

* **Can I train offline ?**

	Yes you can train by compiling and running Sebastian's java server on [github](https://github.com/jeanlaurent/code-elevator).
	
* **I don't speak java, can I train online ?**

	Yes you can train online, without the hassle of maven, java and all the security risk associated with them (joke, people, only a joke) :
	* [David's official server](http://elevator.retour1024.eu.cloudbees.net/#/leaderboard)
	* [Sebastian's server](https://github.com/jeanlaurent/code-elevator)

* **Where can I register ?**

	You can't register for the contest yet, you can train, that's the only thing possible for now. We will announce how to register soon, on the blog.

* **It seems that the sooner I register the more point I win ?**

	Not really, keep in mind we don't keep score yet.
	
	[Sebastian](/team/sebastian) server is meant to be run during a few hours only in another contest. So the scores adds up. But [Yann Bonnel](https://twitter.com/ybonnel) as put up a [web page](http://elevator-scores.ybonnel.cloudbees.net/) that compute the throughput by hour of each elevator. You can use this to evaluate the performance of your elevator code.

* **How the scoring system works ?**

	Chances are, if you're reading this, you're probably able to read code, so go read some [code](https://github.com/jeanlaurent/code-elevator/blob/master/elevator-server/src/main/java/elevator/server/Score.java), or ask [Sebastian](/team/sebastian) directly.

* **Who wrote the elevator-server ?**

	[Sebastian Lemerdy](/team/sebastian), wrote the server, It's meant to be run in a 3 hours programming contest hosted in house. Sebastian started working on the server code last year, he already organize a few sessions with more than 40 people battling for the best elevator. It's clone of the famous extreme startup programming contest, originaly run in [XPDay Benelux](http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2011/sessions/Extreme%20Startup.html) Conference.
	If you're intrested, [Sebastian](/team/sebastian) is runnning this contest Thursday, September 26th, you can still [register](http://codeelevator.eventbrite.fr/). By going there, you'll have a lot of fun and probably will learn a few things about programming but it will not give you an edge, nor score etcâ€¦ in the code-story contest.

* **Can I use <Insert Here Some Programming Language> ?**

	Yes you can use watever language you want, even mix languages (Javaist used to mix quite a good deal of xml with their java code, especially Spring fans)

* **Ok, but really can I use Scala ?**

	Yes any language, even Scala. We have a great deal of good friends, who call themselves scalafist, who love this language. Oh, by the way those guys are putting up a [conference](http://scala.io), you should attend. 

* **Is this still a contest to win a place to live code at Devoxx France ?**

	No, for this 3rd edition, the contest is independant of the Devoxx Conference. We have some feedbacks of people not participating to the contest because [they](https://www.google.fr/search?q=chicken) are not intrested in live coding in front of people. We respect that, and we would love to see the contest getting bigger.
	
* **Will there be some Code Story Live Coding at Devoxx France then ?**

	Only time will tell.

* **How many episode will there be ?**

	We don't know, probably between 3 and 6.

* **What's the next episode ?**

	It will be announced in the code-story blog.

* **Will I keep my score of episode 1 in the following episode ?**

	Nop, each episode will have it's own score. So if you miss an episode because you want to have real social life rather than coding all night elevator algorithm you should not be impacted.

* **I can haz badgez ?**

	Probably.
