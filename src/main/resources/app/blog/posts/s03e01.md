Hello everyone,

We are actually at the JugSummerCamp conference, and this is the time to announce the first episode of the 3rd season of CodeStory, aka s0301 - The One In The Elevator

# READY ?

More often than not, when I'm waiting for an elevator, especially in an old Parisian building where you can actually see the cabin moving up and down, I try to figure out roughly the algorithm of the elevator. 
It looks basic at first glance, but it's actually not. Should the elevator favour going down? Should it gather everyone on its way up and then go down in one go? Should it know how many people are actually waiting? Does the algorithm change depending on the number of people using it?

By participating at this first episode of the 3rd season of CodeStory, you'll have a unique opportunity to figure that out, the challenge is to find the **Best Elevator Algorithm**.

# GET SET ?

For the next 3 weeks, up until Monday, October 14th, you'll have to read the rules, gather friends to join your team and write the **Best Elevator Algorithm**. 

## Team or Solo ?

Everyone who enters the challenge is registered as an individual, but you can join a (single) team. At CodeStory we tend to prefer people who join forces to achieve better results.
There will be a ranking for teams and a one for individuals. You can join a team made of colleagues, your local User Group, Region or whatever crosses your mind (Cat Lovers Team anyone?).

## Where are the rule ?

The rules of the challenge are the one explained in the gorgeous code-elevator project invented and maintained by Sebastian Lemerdy. Yes you remember him, he coded live in front of a lot of people during the 1st season of CodeStory. We are talking about this Sebastian! 

He wrote, with some friends, an elevator server available at [github](https://github.com/jeanlaurent/code-elevator).

You have to write an algorithm for a 6 stories building. The elevator can do one of those 5 actions :

* `OPEN`: open the elevator doors
* `CLOSE`: close the elevator doors
* `UP` : the elevator goes up one floor
* `DOWN`: the elevator goes down one floor
* `NOTHING`: The elevator does not move nor operate the doors

People can `CALL` the elevator at a specific floor, once the have entered the elevator (don't forget to OPEN the doors firstâ€¦) they can indicate where they want to `GO` by indicating the floor at which they want to leave the cabin.

The github project provides a server to test your algorithm. You'll need maven and a Java jdk, but everything is well described in the ReadMe available [here](https://github.com/jeanlaurent/code-elevator).

# GO !

On Monday, October 14th, we'll disclose the final rules of the challenge. We'll build something similar to Sebastian's server. But with a couple of changes. Surprise! If you manage to have a decent score on Sebastian's Elevator, chances are that you are on the right track.

You'll get another 3 weeks to send us your code. It we will evaluated and ranked.

Any language can be used, on a JVM or not, readable or not.

## Ranking !

We will look at the code and the algorithm, appreciate it, run it if we can, and rank it. You'll possibly need to help us a bit on the 'run' phase. More on that later.

We hope you'll have as much fun participating to the challenge that we have in preparing and running it.

Jean-Laurent & David.
