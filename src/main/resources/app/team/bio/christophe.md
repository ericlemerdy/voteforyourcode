Hello my name is [Christophe Labouisse](https://twitter.com/XtlCnslt). I started software development in the early 1980th (in this time most people associated computers with the one onboard the [Enterprise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise)) in BASIC on a [Commodore PET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PET_computer). It quickly became a devouring passion that hasn't left me ever since.

I love writing clean and efficient code, being part of a great team as well as getting my hands dirty in garbage collection issues and other technical challenges. I believe that change is one of the most important part of software development so I'm always happy to discover a new framework, language or method as long as it helps moving things in the right direction.

I had the opportunity to work for various companies such as SNCF, Mycom, Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking, GHX France as an employee or a contractor. I start as a freelancer in 2008 and moved to the Bordeaux areas in 2012 thanks to ITS Group.
