<h1>Hi! I'm Jean-Laurent de Morlhon</h1>

<p>
    I&#8217;m a passionated developer, have co-founded <a href='http://serpodile.com'>Serpodile</a>
    to help all the kids write easily and am an happy father of 4 kids. I write software for almost 15 years.<br/>
    I'm a former CTO @ Xebia, before that I was leading dev teams @ Vidal, Valtech & Colt Telecom.
</p>

<p>
    I love the act of writing software transforming a vague idea from the mind of someone, into an efficient
    software which really helps.
</p>

<p>
    Writing software is often associated with bloat, bugs, late, unmaintainable code and crappy interface. I
    like challenging this idea, and thrive to convince people that there is another way of writing software. 
    You&#8217;ll here me talk about software craftsmanship, defend the role of the developer in software
    products and the like.
</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;m a tdd guy, and I host many <a href='http://coderetreat.org/about'>coderetreats</a>, to meet clever
    developpers, learn new techniques, and just train.
