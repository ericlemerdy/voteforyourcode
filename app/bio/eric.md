[Eric](http://twitter.com/ericlemerdy) is especially happy when he codes.

Led by Agile spirit, he enjoys belonging to a cool code team and sharing its happiness. In addition to his interest for practicing the art of programming, he also likes theory. Lean Software Developement satisfies his interest for both japanese culture and people empowering models that work.

Inspired by Software Craftsmanship, he tries to remove a feature every day and evict legacy from this world (legacy being code that could have been written the day before by himself).

He is a happy member of [Valtech Technology Paris](http://blog.valtech.fr).
