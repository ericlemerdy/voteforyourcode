    Hello, I&#8217;m <a href='http://twitter.com/xavierhanin'>Xavier Hanin</a>, and I am dev-aholic.
</p>

<p>
    It&#8217;s been a while now, I&#8217;ve written my first for loop in BASIC on a thompson MO5 when I was 10,
    moved to C when I was 17, code in Java since 1997 and JS since 2006.
</p>

<p>
    I&#8217;m working for <a href='http://4sh.fr/'>4SH</a>, where I&#8217;ve founded the Java and Web
    development team in Bordeaux in 2008. Together with a team of 15 talented and passionated people, we help
    software editors to face their challenges.
</p>

<p>
    Besides my job, I created <a href='http://ant.apache.org/ivy'>Apache Ivy</a> in 2004 and lead it to the ASF
    in 2006. This experience has been tremendous, it lead me to famous places like the Stanford University, EMC2
    labs, SAS headquarters or LinkedIn. I&#8217;ve also been a speaker at a few european conferences, I have
    founded the <a href='http://bordeauxjug.org/'>BordeauxJUG</a> in 2008, and I&#8217;m teaching at
    <a href='http://www.enseirb-matmeca.fr'>ENSEIRB MATMECA</a> since 10 years.
