    Hello my name is <a href='https://twitter.com/XtlCnslt'>Christophe Labouisse</a>. I started software
    development in the early 1980th (in this time most people associated computers with the one onboard the
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise'>Enterprise</a>) in BASIC on a
    <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PET_computer'>Commodore PET</a>. It quickly became a devouring passion
    that hasn&#8217;t left me ever since.
</p>

<p>
    I love writing clean and efficient code, being part of a great team as well as getting my hands dirty in
    garbage collection issues and other technical challenges. I believe that change is one of the most important
    part of software development so I&#8217;m always happy to discover a new framework, language or method as
    long as it helps moving things in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
    I had the opportunity to work for various companies such as SNCF, Mycom, Société Générale Corporate and
    Investment Banking, GHX France as an employee or a contractor. I start as a freelancer in 2008 and moved to
    the Bordeaux areas in 2012 thanks to ITS Group.
